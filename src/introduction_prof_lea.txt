Greetings Dr. Kel,

welcome to your new job and our team!

My name is Prof. Lea, and I am your direct supervisor.

Since you've made it here, it's safe to assume that you've made it through the learning period.
However, allow me to reiterate what your job is and what you have to do:

Your main responsibility is to scan space for anomalous signals.
If possible, you should process the signals you find to improve their quality.

Store the signals you gathered on analogue drives and send them to us.
For each drive sent to us, you will receive a respective reward.
Signals that have been processed to a higher quality level will yield a greater reward.
Your colleagues will request a specified set of drives from you on a daily basis.

During your work, you will have to perform maintenance on the both the servers inside the base and the servers of the telescope dishes.
You may have to occasionally fix a server that encounters a problem and/or shuts down.

In order to keep your workflow as high as possible, make sure to regularly check the calibrations of the telescopes.
You may adjust the calibration of all telescope via the console terminal inside the base.
However, if a telescope server is down, it can not be accessed remotely until it is fixed on site.

I believe I have covered the essentials.
Regarding the nuclear reactor: you don't need to worry about that. It's not currently implemented.

Gather the signals, process them, send them back to us for your reward, maintain the servers - and you'll be just fine.



Good luck!

Prof. Lea
