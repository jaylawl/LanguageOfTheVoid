    Hello Dr. Kel,

    I am unable to work with some of the hash-code data you sent today.
    They appear to be invalid - maybe you have made an error while copying them.

    Ensure that you've got the correct hash-codes and send them to me.

    Invalid telescope hash-code(s):
        - Charlie
        - Kilo



    Regards,

    Dr. Bao
