// My idea is to send this e-mail when the player sends a drive box, but not everything is there yet.
// As things are (as of version 0.5.2), you will be immediately scolded by Dr. Bao for not delivering everything at once.
// But, delivering everything at once may not be possible, due to the amount of drives requested being >8.
